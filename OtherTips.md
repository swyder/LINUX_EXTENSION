## Filesystem navigation

Command | Task
--------| --------------------------
pushd   | pushes a directory onto a stack and switches to it
popd    | removes the current directory from the stack and changes to the previous one
dirs    | list current stack
cd -    | change back to the previous directory


### Other useful commands

htop  
tree  

Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line (for Venn diagrams).  
comm  

### Following a log file as it grows
tail -f <some log file>  
less +F <some log file>   


### tricks using find

This command will find all the files accessed more than 10 days ago
```
find / -atime +10 -print  
```

The command below lists all files larger than 1Gb:
```
find / -size +1G 2>/dev/null | xargs du -h  
```

The line above doesn't work if file name contains spaces. Allowing for file names containing whitespaces:
```
find / -size +1G -print0 2>/dev/null | xargs -0 du -h
```

### Bash safe mode

```
set -euxo pipefail  
```

from https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/  
  
Often times developers go about writing bash scripts the same as writing code in a higher-level language. This is a big mistake as higher-level languages offer safeguards that are not present in bash scripts by default. For example, a Ruby script will throw an error when trying to read from an uninitialized variable, whereas 
a bash script wonâ€™t.


### brace expansion - filename or list generation

```
echo foo.{bar,baz,ree}
foo.bar foo.baz foo.ree
```

```
mv file{.txt,.bak} # mv file.txt file.bak
mv file{,.`date "+%F"} # mv file file.2011-11-27
```
